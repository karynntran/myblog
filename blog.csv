Sessions,"Sessions are a special part of the contract between a client and a server in the request/response cycle of an HTTP request.

HTTP itself is stateless, but a session allows you to preserve data between requests, thereby giving an impression of continuity. Sessions are the reason why you don't have to actively log in all the time. 

A session exists when the first web request to the server from the client is created and can live for a custom amount of time. By default, when the browser is closed, the session dies. You can store all sorts of information in the session, but you shouldn't, because it takes space in memory (or in a database, etc) and there usually are better ways to store data. 

Only use the session in exceptional circumstances, like authorization/permissions.",2014-10-23T00:00:00+00:00

one-to-many,"The basic SQL relationship. If there are two tables, owners and dogs, and an owner can have many dogs, then:
